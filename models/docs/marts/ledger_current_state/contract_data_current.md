[comment]: < Contract Data current -

{% docs contract_data_current %}
This table maps a given contract data entry (contract_id and ledgerKey hash) to its current status. In the case of SAC contracts, it will also return the current balance when a contract is the balance holder. Wallet balances are reported in the trustlines table. The Contract data table does not contain custom data saved in a Soroban contract.
